# Sorting Visualiser

[Sorting Visualiser]

**Sorting Visualiser** is a web-based tool designed to help you visualize and understand complex sorting algorithms through interactive and animated visualizations. This project provides a hands-on way to learn about various sorting techniques and see how they work in action.

## Features

- **Interactive Interface:** A user-friendly web interface that allows you to choose different sorting algorithms and visualize how they sort an array.

- **Multiple Sorting Algorithms:** Implementations of several classic sorting algorithms, including Bubble Sort, Heap Sort, Merge Sort, and Quick Sort.

- **Randomized Data Generation:** Generate random arrays of varying sizes to test and visualize how each algorithm performs.

- **Step-by-Step Visualization:** Watch the sorting process step by step, with each step being animated, so you can see how elements are swapped and rearranged.

- **Speed Control:** Adjust the speed of the visualization to see the sorting process in slow motion or at lightning speed.

## Getting Started

These instructions will help you set up the Sorting Visualiser project on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following requirements:

- **Web Browser:** You will need a modern web browser to run and interact with the visualizer.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/prakirnakeshi/Sorting_Visualiser.git

Navigate to the project directory:

Copy code
cd Sorting_Visualiser/Sorting-Visualizer-master
Open the index.html file in your preferred web browser.

Explore and visualize different sorting algorithms with the provided options.

### Usage
Select a sorting algorithm from the dropdown menu.
Adjust the array size and animation speed as needed.
Click the "Generate" button to create a random array.
Click the "Sort" button to start the visualization.
